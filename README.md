## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Notes

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **Redux State Management**: Implemented custom type definitions and transformations to handle immutability challenges with comment structures
2. **Infinite Scroll**: Built a performant scroll implementation using Intersection Observer API
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript implementation for robust error prevention
4. **Bookmark System**: In-memory bookmark storage with plans for persistent storage implementation

### Time Management

-   First day: Basic structure and home page implementation
-   Second day: Explore and Bookmarks pages
-   Third day: Profile page and general improvements
-   Fourth day: Bug fixes, documentation, eslint and build processes. I had trouble with eslint and build processes for the first time, so it took longer than expected.
